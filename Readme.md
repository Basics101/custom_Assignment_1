## Hello Ivo

> For this assignment I will be creating a custom website and launching it on github pages. I want you to recreate the site.

## Requirements

>Use of git
>Minimum of 20 commits (yes I will be able to check your commits, and version history so I will know if you copy and paste code)
>Have Fun!!


## Usage

- `gulp watch`: This will launch a Node Server and start the standard `watchlist` task
- `gulp bower`: This will move the bower components into their proper location. This will run during the `watch` task, but you may need to run it manually once in a while

There are many more tasks, and you really should read through the `gulpfile.js`, but the ones above will take care of you in most cases.
